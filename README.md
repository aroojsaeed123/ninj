#Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project was to create a clock of two different time zones with the option to add an hour.
#What did you do particularly well?
i created a string which pops us on display screen
#Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
In creating time zones i should use switch statement instead of while.
#Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
For creating a time zone in two different zone is not that easy. I knew how to add an hour according to user input
#What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
The use of while and if-else statements should be practiced more
#How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
With continuous guidance from my professor, i am able to create this project.
